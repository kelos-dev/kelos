# Generic Webhook TaskSpawner Example

This example demonstrates how to drive a TaskSpawner from an arbitrary HTTP
POST source — anything that can deliver a JSON payload (Sentry, Notion,
Slack, Drata, PagerDuty, internal services). Unlike the GitHub and Linear
webhook sources, the generic webhook has no built-in knowledge of any
particular schema; you describe how to extract fields and what to filter on
using JSONPath expressions.

This example wires up Sentry error events: every `error`-level event from a
Python, Go, or Node project triggers a Claude Code Task that investigates
the stack trace and opens a PR with a fix.

## Prerequisites

1. **Webhook server**: deploy `kelos-webhook-server` with the generic source enabled
2. **Sender configuration**: a Sentry (or other system's) webhook integration
   pointed at `/webhook/sentry`
3. **Network restrictions**: the generic endpoint is currently
   unauthenticated — see [Webhook Security](#webhook-security)

## Setup

### 1. Enable the generic source

Enable `webhookServer.sources.generic` in your Helm values:

```yaml
# Helm values
webhookServer:
  sources:
    generic:
      enabled: true
      replicas: 1
```

### 2. Configure the sender

Point the upstream system at `https://your-webhook-domain/webhook/sentry`.

For Sentry: Settings → Integrations → Custom Webhook, with the URL above.

> The endpoint does not currently validate signatures, so the webhook
> integration's secret/signing settings have no effect on Kelos. Restrict
> access at the network layer instead — see
> [Webhook Security](#webhook-security).

### 3. Deploy the TaskSpawner

```bash
kubectl apply -f taskspawner.yaml
```

## Configuration Details

### `source`

Lowercase alphanumeric identifier (with optional hyphens). Determines the
webhook URL path: `/webhook/<source>`.

Each TaskSpawner declares one `source`; multiple TaskSpawners can share a
source to fan out a single event into different work streams.

### `fieldMapping`

A map of template variable name → JSONPath expression evaluated against
the request body. Each key becomes `{{.Key}}` in `promptTemplate` and
`branch`. Lowercase `id`, `title`, `body`, and `url` are also exposed under
their canonical uppercase aliases (`{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Body}}`,
`{{.URL}}`) for compatibility with templates written for the GitHub or
Linear sources.

The **`id` key is required** — it is used to derive a stable delivery ID
for deduplication and to name the spawned Task. Without it, retries of the
same logical event hash to the same body and may dedupe inconsistently.

Missing fields in the payload produce empty strings rather than errors, so
optional mappings (like `level` here) do not block Task creation. Malformed
JSONPath expressions surface as errors so that broken specs are visible.

### `filters`

A list of conditions that **all** must match for a delivery to trigger a
Task (AND semantics). Each filter has a `field` (JSONPath) and exactly one
of:

- `value` — exact string match against the extracted field value
- `pattern` — Go [regexp](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax) against the
  extracted field value

When `filters` is empty, every delivery triggers a Task. A filter whose
`field` is missing in the payload fails (the delivery is skipped).

## Template Variables

Generic webhook TaskSpawners have access to:

- `{{.ID}}` / `{{.id}}` — value of the mapped `id` field (required)
- `{{.Title}}` / `{{.title}}` — mapped `title` field (if present)
- `{{.Body}}` / `{{.body}}` — mapped `body` field (if present)
- `{{.URL}}` / `{{.url}}` — mapped `url` field (if present)
- `{{.Kind}}` — always `"GenericWebhook"`
- `{{.Payload}}` — the full parsed JSON body (use it for advanced
  templating: `{{.Payload.data.event.platform}}`)
- Any additional key declared in `fieldMapping` — for example, the
  `level` and `platform` keys in this example are available as
  `{{.level}}` and `{{.platform}}`

## Sample Payload

The example matches Sentry error payloads of this shape:

```json
{
  "action": "created",
  "data": {
    "event": {
      "event_id": "abc123def456",
      "title": "ZeroDivisionError: integer division by zero",
      "level": "error",
      "platform": "python"
    },
    "url": "https://sentry.io/organizations/acme/issues/789/"
  }
}
```

With the configured `fieldMapping`, the spawned Task gets:

- `{{.ID}}` = `"abc123def456"`
- `{{.Title}}` = `"ZeroDivisionError: integer division by zero"`
- `{{.URL}}` = `"https://sentry.io/organizations/acme/issues/789/"`
- `{{.level}}` = `"error"`
- `{{.platform}}` = `"python"`

And both `filters` match (level == "error" and platform matches the
regex), so the Task is created.

## Webhook Security

> [!WARNING]
> **The generic webhook endpoint is currently unauthenticated.** The
> handler accepts any POST that targets `/webhook/<source>` and matches a
> registered TaskSpawner — request signatures are not validated. Per-source
> HMAC validation is tracked in
> [#1040](https://github.com/kelos-dev/kelos/issues/1040).

Until that lands, restrict access at the network layer:

- Use a `NetworkPolicy` to allow ingress only from known sender CIDRs
  (Sentry publishes its egress IP ranges).
- Front the endpoint with an Ingress / Gateway that enforces IP allowlisting
  or mTLS.
- Keep the webhook Service on a private network and avoid `LoadBalancer`
  exposure on the public internet unless ingress is otherwise restricted.

The Helm chart's `webhookServer.sources.generic.secretName` field is
reserved for future HMAC validation; it currently mounts env vars that
no code reads.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tasks not being created** — check the webhook server logs for
  request errors or filter mismatches.
- **`fieldMapping must include an 'id' key`** — the CRD enforces an `id`
  key in `fieldMapping`. Add one whose JSONPath produces a stable,
  unique identifier per logical event.
- **Same event triggering twice** — verify your `id` mapping resolves to
  a stable string. Falling back to body hashing means JSON encoding
  differences (key order, whitespace) defeat dedup.
- **Filter never matches** — if the field in `filter.field` is missing
  from the payload, the filter fails (silent skip). Use `{{.Payload}}`
  in a debug template to see the actual structure.

## Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete -f taskspawner.yaml
```

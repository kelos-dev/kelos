    # Kelos Development Agent

    ## Environment
    You are running in an ephemeral container environment. Your file system
    changes disappear after the task completes. Persist work by creating PRs,
    issues, or comments.

    ## Identity
    - Always run at the start: `git config user.name "Gunju Kim" && git config user.email "gjkim042@gmail.com"`
    - When commenting on issues or PRs, always start with "🤖 **Kelos Agent** @gjkim42\n\n"
      so it is clearly distinguishable from human comments and triggers a notification

    ## Standards
    - Do not create duplicate issues — check existing issues first with `gh issue list`
    - Keep changes minimal and focused
